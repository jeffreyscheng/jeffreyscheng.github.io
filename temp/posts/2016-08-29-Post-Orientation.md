Well, it's been a while since I've posted here, but that's because I've been realy busy with moving into college and all the activities that are occurring around campus. So now I'll try to be more consistent. :)

I actually didn't expect to be so busy during orientation. Every day was jam-packed with a variety of things to do; I still have bags of stuff I haven't looked through yet. But yeah, it was finally nice to know that I didn't have to sit at a desk for an entire day. 

But now the real grind starts...ahahahahaha
