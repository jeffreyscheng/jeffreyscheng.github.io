I've got a cubing competition tomorrow! It's been several months since my last competition, so hopefully I find this competition very refreshing. 

I don't really have any goals for this competition, but my main goal is to sort of reignite my passion for cubing. Lately that fire has faded a bit, and I felt as if I hadn't had the same drive as I did a year ago. 

We'll see how it goes.
