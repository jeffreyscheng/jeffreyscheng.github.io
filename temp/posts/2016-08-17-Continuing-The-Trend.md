Considering making this a daily thing...but I'm pretty sure I'll run out of things to blog about. 

I've always really wondered how drastic of a change college will actually be. Will it simply be a smooth transition? Or will it be a huge slap in the face? I hate asking myself these questions, but unfortunately the answer will only come from firsthand experience. Darn, I tell myself. 

While we're still procrastinating on those bags, with every additional item that I think to bring only increments the level of anxiety I have for the future. So then I stop and go do something probably more distracting.

I dunno. It's futile worrying about this kind of stuff, so again, we gotta stay optimistic about all this.
