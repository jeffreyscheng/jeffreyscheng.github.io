What a competition! Unfortunately we were super behind schedule and had to cut the third round of every event, I still managed to pull together some good results.

My highlights:

* 9.47 Square-1 World Record average (beats my old one of 9.90)
* 7.92 Square-1 single
* 57.xx Megaminx single, 1:02.xx Megaminx average, which is ~70th in the world
* 2.90 Pyraminx single

Videos will be up soon!
