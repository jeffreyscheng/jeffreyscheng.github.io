description: "For 60+ years, neuroscientists have debated what a Hebbian update rule might look like.  The HAT algorithm directly meta-learns the optimal local, unsupervised update rule.  We demonstrate that HAT outperforms standard gradient descent methods, and we investigate the functional form of the meta-learned update rule."
