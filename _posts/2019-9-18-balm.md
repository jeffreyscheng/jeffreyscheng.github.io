title: "Bilingual is at Least Monolingual (BALM)"
date: 2019-9-18
year: 2019
category: "Project"
kind: "Research paper, submitted to XXX"
problem: "Machine translation algorithms fail when a pair of languages lacks bilingual corpora (e.g. Chinese and Italian)."
insight: "This is the equivalent of asking a child who knows neither Chinese nor Italian to become a professional Chinese-Italian translator with no reference materials."
solution: "\"Teach the kid Chinese and Italian\" -- we incorporate monolingual inductive biases into the MT pipeline using a BERT encoder and a BERT-inverting decoder.  This reduces MT to a fixed-length mapping problem in embedding space, which can be solved with non-recurrent techniques."
result: "State-of-the-art performance on German-to-English translation using a feedforward neural network."
description: "Machine translation algorithms fail when a pair of languages lacks bilingual corpora (e.g. Chinese and Italian).  This is the equivalent of asking a child who knows neither Chinese nor ITalian to become a professional Chinese-Italian translator with no reference materials.  Thus, the BALM algorithm \"teaches the kid Chinese and Italian\" -- we incorporate monolingual inductive biases into the MT pipeline using a BERT encoder and a BERT-inverting decoder.  This reduces MT to a fixed-length mapping problem in embedding space, which can be solved with non-recurrent techniques.  BALM achieves state-of-the-art performance on German-to-English translation using a feedforward neural network."
