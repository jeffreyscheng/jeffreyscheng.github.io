description: "I wanted to be the very best (like no one ever was) on Pokemon Showdown, an online competitive platform with millions of players.  Based on monthly usage statistics, I hypothesized that Pokemon that \"look cool\" are used too frequently.  I then created a genetic algorithm to create teams that exploit the metagame inefficiencies caused by cosmetic bias.  The algorithm returns teams in the 99.99999th percentile; for a short period of time.  Winner of the UPenn 2017 CIS Fair and (for a time) #1 ranked team on the Pokemon Showdown Elo ladder."
