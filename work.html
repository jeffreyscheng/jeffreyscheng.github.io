                            <p><small>Any enterprise chatbot to understand time: its job is to book meetings, schedule deposits -- anything a human call center agent could do.  Prior to my work, Watson's understanding of time was based on an if-else ladder of about 800,000 rules.  These rules had to be manually written in every language and led to ridiculous heuristics.  For example, if you talked to Watson on Tuesday about having made a deposit on a Wednesday, Watson would assume you meant the closest Wednesday (tomorrow) ... and spontaneously combust.</small></p>
                            <p><small>I created a deep learning module so that Watson could disambiguate time entities using conversational context.  This not only improved performance and robustness but also reduced the lead time for supporting new languages from 6 months (give or take) down to a single afternoon.</small></p>

                            <p><small>In every game (from chess to Super Smash Bros), people enjoy competition more if they are pitted against opponents of similar skill levels; noobs don't want to be constantly destroyed, and pros want a challenge.  For games like chess, simple probabilistic solutions like Elo can assign players a skill number quite easily based on their win-loss records.</small></p>
                            <p><small>For games like Battlefield One, determining a player's skill is quite difficult: win-loss record is no longer indicative of anything when matches are fought between teams of 32.  I created a custom skill metric for these games based on in-game behavior (e.g. kill-death ratio, rate of movement, weapons used) and wrote a stable-matching algorithm that increased player retention by 12% in alpha-tests.</small></p>
